# Robogotchi
Do you remember Tamagotchi â€” small digital toy pets that you carry around and take care of? They used to be popular in the 2000s, but since then, technology really advanced, and now you can get an actual robopet! In this project, I wrote a robogotchi pet that you care for, play with, and oil every so often.
